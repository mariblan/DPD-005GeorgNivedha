HTML | Chapter Project

This is a two parts project in which you will create an underlying structure of a webpage. In this first part you need to create the structure only using HTML. Once you have created a basic structure and added all important elements, then we will add some styling and content.

🎯 Goals
Design an underlying structure of a webpage
Create a form using HTML elements
Identify the structure of HTML elements and the tags it contains
Differentiate between content hierarchy and organization of a web page using semantic HTML
📝 Steps:

Create a new HTML5 (static) project on CodeSandbox or StackBlitz
Create the boilerplate of your HTML page (you can do it easily with Emmet and the shortcut !)
Create a navigation (“Home”, “Contact”, “About Us”) by having a list of links inside a <nav> tag
Create a footer with the id about
Create a header (h3) in your footer with the text About Us
Inside this footer place some text, it can be simply a ”Lorem Ipsum” for now
In your navigation bar, click on the link “About Us” and make the page travel to the position on the page of the id about
Create an article tag in which you have:
– An H2 title, you can have a small “Lorem Ipsum” as a title for now
– An image, with a fixed height of 200px, for that you can use a placeholder
– A paragraph with a Lorem Ipsum inside
Create a second page named contact.html
Copy/paste the navigation bar from your index.html into this page
Copy/paste the footer from your index.html into this page
In this page create a <form> with:
– An input type text
– A textarea
– A button to submit the form
